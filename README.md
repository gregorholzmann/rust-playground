# A Sandbox For Rust Learning
A simple "21"-style command line game

## Dev
To spin up the project, you must first [install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html). This will also install Cargo, which you will use for development and builds.

Run the `cargo run` command to see a local version of the game.

## Build
To build a debug build, run `cargo build`.
For a release, run `cargo build --relase`.
